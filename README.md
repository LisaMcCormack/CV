# Lisa McCormack

A full stack junior developer looking for my first opportunity once my course at Makers Academy finishes in July 2019.  A firm convert to TDD and Agile methodologies, I have a passion for coding as well as a strong drive to be part of a high performing and closely aligned team.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

The biggest skill I have been gifted with at Makers is the ability to be a self-lead learner.  With my passion for tech, I am motivated to study and be language agnostic.  

#### Teamwork

I firm believer in the effectiveness of Agile, I enjoy being part of a team that collaborates and communicates closely.  My experience being a teacher has exposed me numerous times to large groups of different personalities and this means that I have a flexible approach to dealing with the variety of people that I work with and am quick to see the positive side.
