## Lisa McCormack

After completing a degree in English Literature,  I spent the next six years working in the finance departments of a multinational construction company, a local government body and a formula one racing team.  Whilst working full time I achieved part-qualified status with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.  

Despite working in the glamourous and prestigious surroundings of McLaren, the idea of leaving England to move to a different country where I would have to build a new life seemed exponentially more exciting than following a career I felt didn't fully allow me to express my talents.  Teaching English and living abroad has taught me invaluable skills and led to enormous personal development where I have gained a better understanding of myself and other people.  

I started learning to code in December 2018 and it has changed my life.  Coding gave me the mental challenge I was looking for and naturally became part of my daily routine.  I bring a strong desire to learn and write code of excellent quality following best practices.  

## Skills

#### Driven to Improve

I am a perfectionist, and this pushes me to be stronger faster.  I want to receive feedback and criticism so that I know where to make improvements.

#### 

I could have spent my 20s working in accountancy but I was bold enough to try something new and when I look back at what I have achieved in the past six years I feel proud.  

#### A Team Player

From helping less experienced teachers in Japan to helping fellow cohorts at my coding bootcamp, I am a natural team player and want my colleagues and team members be the best people they can be.  I'm always willing to listen to and encourage people and genuinely have their best interests at heart.  I also have so much to learn from collaboration with other people.
