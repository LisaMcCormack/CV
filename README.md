# Lisa McCormack

A full stack junior developer and a firm convert to TDD and Agile methodologies, I have a passion for coding as well as a strong drive to be part of a high performing and closely aligned team.

I studied English Literature at university because I enjoyed reading and wanted to be able to write finely crafted essays. After university I followed my mother's footsteps into the world of accountancy and became part qualified. Feeling like I had plenty of job experience but somewhat lacking in life experience, I decided that moving to a new country, picking up new skills and building a new life was more exciting than trying to advance in an industry I felt was not right for me. I taught English in Japan and then France and this lead to enormous amounts of personal development and I became a more confident and experienced individual.

Our daily lives are filled with technology and it excites me that I could be working on an app that could be used by thousands if not millions of people. Technology helps solve problems and I enjoy finding solutions; how to build something, researching, talking about it with different people and being creative. 




## Projects

|Project| Description | Technology | 
|---|---|---|
|<a href="https://github.com/LisaMcCormack/acebook-spacebook">spacebook</a></br> Deployed on <a href="https://acebook-spacebook.herokuapp.com"/>heroku</a>| The main focus of the Spacebook project was to work well as a team using Agile methodology as well as producing high quality code following best practices.  We received feedback from our coach who praised how well we documented the project and our flair for creativity. | Ruby on Rails, Rspec,  Capybara, HTML, Travis CI  Heroku, PSQL |
|<a href="https://github.com/LisaMcCormack/gilded_rose">Gilded Rose</a> |  Solo project - I completed the famous Gilded Rose challenge in one day and it taught me a lot about how to go about approaching problem solving.  Makers has been invaluable for teaching students about the process - we should break down the problem into the smallest steps and do the simplest thing first.  It was also a challenge that showed the effectiveness of TDD; to pass the tests the refactored code had to behave the same way as the original code. | Ruby, Rspec |
|<a href="https://github.com/LisaMcCormack/PowerOfTruth">Power Of Truth</a> | My final project at Makers,  we decided to take the difficulty level to the max by picking a tech stack we hadn't worked with before - React Native.  With React Native not being the most intuitive of frameworks, it challenged us all but in the end we were extremely proud of the app we produced. | React Native, Jest, Google News API |
|<a href="https://github.com/LisaMcCormack/rps-challenge">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> | The first solo project at Makers that I was really proud of.  It was a project that I refactored heavily and gave me good understanding of MVC.  It was also excellent practise in TDD and mocking.  | Ruby, Rspec, Sinatra, Capybara, CSS |
|<a href="https://github.com/LisaMcCormack/bank_tech_test">Bank tech test</a> | Solo project - I completed the bank tech test in one day to practise OO, design and TDD skills.  After reviewing and reflecting I was able to refactor the code.  | JavaScript, Jasmine |

## Skills

#### Fast learner

The biggest skill I have been gifted with at Makers is the ability to be a self-lead learner.  At Makers we were presented with new technologies every week and this required fast and effective thinking to stay on top of the game.  Changing careers from accountancy to teaching required a whole new set of skills and adaptability.  With my passion for tech, I am motivated to study and be language agnostic.  

#### Teamwork

I firm believer in the effectiveness of Agile, I enjoy being part of a team that collaborates and communicates closely.  

#### Problem Solving

Test driven development requires you to take the problem, break it down and consider what the first step should be.  
The ability to think analytically, perservere and take a problem and break it down into smaller solvable ones is the key to good software development.

## Experience

**Freelance English Tutor, Paris ** (January 2017 to March 2019) 

This improved my public speaking skills.  For Makers final project we presented our project to a large live audience as well as an internet audience and after performing songs and dancing in front of parents, I was remarkably at ease compared to how I would have been pre-teaching career.

**English Instructor, Tokyo ** (March 2014 to July 2016)   

This gave me real insight into team work.  I taught large groups of children and saw how group dynamics work with all the different personality types and I can now appreciate how we are all different and how I should have a flexible approach in how I work with individuals to get the best results and build relationships.  I also worked in a small team of other teachers and managers where we would work together to improve standards, formulate strategies for retaining students and come up with ways to attract new students to the school.

## Interests


üíªTechnologyüíª

From software developer YouTube channels to Medium blogs, I am an avid consumer of tech and the people who shape this industry.

üë©üèªPeople, Teamwork, Agileüë®üèø

In both social and professional contexts, people are what make me tick.   From Makers to past employment I have seen that the success of a project depends a great deal on communication and how well the team is bonded.

üìñPersonal Developmentüßò

Throughout my life, I have constantly been learning.  I started my career in Accountancy and took many professional exams, I studied French and Japanese while living in those countries, I am currently learning software engineering all in the desire to enrich my life with knowledge.  Yoga and meditation also help to look after mind and body.

üß≥Travel, cinema, books, filmüé•

Fairly typical interests but anything that helps unlock life‚Äôs mysteries and help me consider alternative points of views and different ways of thinking.
