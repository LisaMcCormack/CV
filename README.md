## Lisa McCormack

After completing a degree in English Literature,  I spent the next six years working in the finance departments of a multinational construction company, a local government body and a formula one racing team.  Whilst working full time I achieved part-qualified status with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.  

Despite working in the glamourous and prestigious surroundings of McLaren, the idea of leaving England to move to a different country where I would have to build a new life seemed exponentially more exciting than following a career I didn't enjoy.  Teaching English and living abroad has taught me invaluable skills and led to enormous personal development where I gained a better understanding of myself and other people.  It has also provided me with the skills to find employment in France where I have been living for the past two years.

I started learning to code in December 2018 and it has changed my life.  Coding gave me the mental challenge I was looking for and naturally became part of my daily routine.  It has proven to me that I am conscientious, determined and perceptive.  I bring a strong desire to learn and write code of excellent quality following best practices.  

## Skills

#### Motivated

I am always looking to gain mastery in fields as diverse as the art of good essay writing, accountancy, classrooom management and new computer languages.  I can be hard on myself, but this pushes me to be stronger faster.  I could have spent my 20s working in accountancy but I was bold enough to try something new and when I look back at what I have achieved in the past six years I feel proud.  

#### Team Player

From helping less experienced teachers in Japan to helping fellow cohorts at my coding bootcamp, I am a natural team player and want my colleagues and team members be the best people they can be.  I'm always willing to listen to and encourage people and genuinely have their best interests at heart.
